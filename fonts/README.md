# Fonts Directory

This directory is used for TTF font files.
Currently, the Fern Graphics library supports basic bitmap fonts by default.
TTF support is experimental.

To add custom fonts:
1. Place .ttf files in this directory
2. Load them using TTF::load("fontName", "filename.ttf") in your application
